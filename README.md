# Project Description

This repository contains a minimal example project demonstrating how to interface an ESP32-S3-Box-3 with a BLE keyboard using NimBLE-Arduino v2.3.4 in a PlatformIO environment.

The project shows how to:

- Establish a BLE connection

- Receive keystrokes from the keyboard (using the HID report protocol, not the boot protocol)

- Print them to the Serial Monitor

The goal is to provide a clear, lightweight reference, since many AI-generated examples tend to be unnecessarily complex or incomplete.
